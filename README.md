## blog-app

This is a pointless app which renders a list of 'blog posts'. The purpose of this was to learn and demonstate usage of Redux with React; as well as utilising redux-thunk to create asynchronous action creators, which in this use case allows action creators to make API calls.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
